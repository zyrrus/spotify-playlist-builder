# spotify-playlist-builder

This was a follow up to my [on-repeat-spotify](https://github.com/zyrrus/on-repeat-spotify) project.  
I tend to make big Spotify playlists that contain many albums and occasionally the entire discographies of some artists. That is a usually a pain to do manually, so I built this as a tool to automate that whole process.

# What I used

Python, Spotipy

# What I learned

-   Got a better understanding of how to use APIs
-   Environment secrets
